Who It's For
Who is Primetrack for
Primetrack is a working tool for those who drive traffic every day and count money. We didn't try to make a universal service "for everyone". It's made for specific tasks.

For affiliates
If you drive traffic yourself and need to see the real picture by sources, Primetrack lets you control every stage — from click to deposit.

You get:

tracking clicks, leads and deposits
detailed statistics by subID (sub1–sub10)
quick launch and scaling of working funnels
All statistics available in one place, without extra screens and reports.

For teams and media buyers
Primetrack is convenient for teams when multiple people work with traffic.

The platform allows you to:

create multiple accounts and projects
separate access between team members
view overall statistics by sources and campaigns
This simplifies team control and gives a transparent picture of results.

For affiliate programs
Primetrack is suitable for tracking and controlling affiliate traffic.

You can:

track clicks, leads and conversions
work with your offers and postback
control traffic quality and detect suspicious activity
The system helps you see where traffic comes from and how it converts.

Advantages
Why it's convenient in real work
No unnecessary modules
Most trackers have many features that look useful in demos but aren't used in real work.

In Primetrack we kept only what's really needed every day: offers, campaigns, subID, postback, statistics and filters.

No CRM logic, complex roles and multi-level scenarios — just tracking and traffic control.

Quick start
We deliberately removed complex onboarding.

After registration, you can immediately create an offer, generate a link and start driving traffic. On average, the first launch takes no more than 5 minutes.

No mandatory integrations and long preliminary settings.

Simple logic
The interface is designed so you don't need to figure it out. All main actions are where you expect to find them.

If you've worked with trackers before, Primetrack will be clear from the first login — without training and reading documentation.

Built for affiliate marketing
Primetrack was developed for real traffic scenarios.

We focus on push sources, gambling and betting offers, working with CPA and RevShare models.

The system correctly receives and sends postback, supports work with subID and gives a complete picture of campaigns.

Features
Everything for managing affiliate programs
Full toolkit for advertisers

Mini-tracker for real traffic
Lightweight tracker without overload. Clicks are processed instantly, each gets a unique click_id, GEO is detected automatically.

Clear statistics
Statistics by offers, partners, geo and devices — in one place. Filters help you quickly understand what to scale and what to disable.

Anti-fraud and quality control
Protection from low-quality traffic: proxies and VPNs, suspicious fingerprints, too fast or repeated clicks.

Postback and Webhooks
Automatic conversion sending to external systems. Support for retries, logging and status monitoring.

Teamwork
Add managers, analysts and finance staff. Access control — everyone sees only what they need.

Custom domains
Connect your domains for tracking links. SSL certificates are issued automatically via Let's Encrypt — no manual hassle.

Finance and payouts
Balance tracking, holds and partner payouts. Crypto integration support and transparent transaction history.

Notifications
Important events always at hand: in-app notifications and Telegram bot. Clicks, conversions and errors — without constantly refreshing pages.

Painless migration
We help you move from Scaleo, Affilka, Affise, Alanbase. Importing offers and data takes 10-15 minutes.

Testimonials
What clients who actually work with Primetrack say
Not marketing quotes — real usage experience

"We moved from Scaleo because we were tired of the overloaded interface. Here it's easier to control traffic and faster to see where the fraud is. In terms of money — we really started losing less on junk traffic."

MediaBuy Pro
MediaBuy Pro
Advertiser / media buying team
"Set up postbacks on the first try, no hassle. Support is responsive and doesn't brush you off — that's rare. We don't use all the features yet, but enough for current tasks."

TrafficLab
TrafficLab
CPA network
"We were looking for a white-label solution so we don't have to build our own tracker. Connected a domain, set up offers — partners work as if it's our platform. For starting and scaling — exactly what we needed."

LeadGen Network

"There are things still being polished, but the team responds quickly. What's more important to us is that the product is developing and we can directly influence features."
